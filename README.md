Calculator
=========
I'm editing this to provide my own functions and complex numbers for me. If it's of use to you then use it. It is not a calculator design for beginers, as it requires quite a lot of mathematical knowledge to do the simplest things. This is due in part to the unique method of calculation.

The display is composed of two lines. The top line is the imaginary part, and the bottom the real part. Numbers are always entered as real, and the imaginary key is used to swap something into the imaginary display value. There is also a universal accumulator which is cleared by the C key when not in backspace correction mode.

The Basic Keys
------------
The basic keys have the following modifications. The equals key is replaced by an accumulation *+* key. This is the primary dyadic operator, in fact the only one. The plus key is replaced by the imaginary *i* key, which multiplies the number on the display by the square root of minus one. The minus key is replaced by the postfix operator sequence *ln i exp* and is called the *k* key. The final two key replacements of the basic keys are times is replaced by *exp* and divide is replaced by *ln* to allow logorithmic calculation. As all functions accept complex arguments, then thre is enough on the basic keys to perfom triganometry, and many other calculations if you know your mathematics.

The Advanced Keys
---------------
The advanced keys are replaced by more advanced keys as would be expected in such a calculator. I will accept no requests for feature changes. If these functions do not suit you then use another calculator. There is no shortage of forks of the origional calculator source.

The first row is
  * ln gamma
  * dichrelet eta
  * riemann zeta

The second row is useful utility functions
  * reciprical root
  * square
  * one minus value

The third row is format conversion
  * imaginary over real as rational
  * convert to rational
  * factorize integer part on display

The fourth row is context control functions
  * push
  * peek
  * pop
